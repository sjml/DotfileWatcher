# DotfileWatcher

You can download a compiled version from [the releases page](https://github.com/sjml/DotfileWatcher/releases/).

Watches a designated directory (default: `~/.dotfiles`) and pops an icon in
the status bar if anything's changed that hasn't been committed to git. From
the icon, you can open `~/.dotfiles` the app of your choice (default: Finder).

Throw it in Login Items and let it do it's thing.

Could be set up to be more configurable, but it does what I need.
